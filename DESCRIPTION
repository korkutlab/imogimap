Description: Imogimap (Immuno-oncology gene interaction maps)automates searches for combinatorial associations and likely functional interactions at the tumor-immune interface to identify the mechanisms that modulate immune-associated phenotypes (e.g., interferon responses, immune infiltration, enrichment of specific immune cell types). The output of ImogiMap is a catalogue of network models involving tumor associated processes (TAP) and immune checkpoints (ICPs) that synergistically co-associate with immune phenotypes (IAPs).
