\title{Calculates and transforms default immune features within a specified sample cohort .}
\usage{
get_features(pdf)
}
\arguments{
\item{pdf}{A numeric data frame or matrix with samples as columns and gene/proteins as rows.}
}
\value{
A list with two dataframes containing transformed values for  immune features and immune cell type fractions as listed in \code{TCGA_immune_features_list}.
}
\description{
Calculates and transforms default immune features within a specified sample cohort .
}
\details{
Given a cohort of samples, calculates immune features within the cohort and transforms their values using probability integral transform. The resulting feature values will have a standard uniform distribution between \code{[0,1]}
