\title{Calculates and transforms default immune features within a specified sample cohort .}
\usage{
get_selected_features(pdf, feature)
}
\arguments{
\item{pdf}{A numeric data frame or matrix with samples as columns and gene/proteins as rows.}

\item{feature}{A list of character identifying one or more of the three expression based features: EMTscore, AGscore, or IFNGscore}
}
\value{
A list with two dataframes containing transformed values for  immune features and immune cell type fractions as listed in \code{TCGA_immune_features_list}.
}
\description{
Calculates and transforms default immune features within a specified sample cohort .
}
\details{
Given a cohort of samples, calculates immune features within the cohort and transforms their values using probability integral transform. The resulting feature values will have a standard uniform distribution between \code{[0,1]}
