\description{
Takes a list of Tumor-intrinsic pathway(TIP) genes and returns their combinatorial association with immune checkpoint(ICP) genes by evaluating their synergistic impact on immune-associated phenotypes(IAP) using RNASeq2GeneNorm expressions as provided by \pkg{curatedTCGAData}.
}
\details{
If no icp_gene is specified, the default icp_gene_list will be used.
If select_iap is a character vector, it must be any sub-list of IAP names as listed in TCGA_immune_features_list. If a numeric matrix or data.frame, each column represents a user-defined IAP and must have a range between \code{[0,1]}. If select_iap is missing all IAPs listed in TCGA_immune_features_list will be considered for analysis.

For synergy score calculations all features are normalized to be on \code{[0,1]} range. For details of synergy score and significance pvalue calculations see \code{find_a_synergy} function.

A specificity p.value is computed using random sampling with replacement from two null models, generated from one of the two genes against a set of genes randomly selected from the genome. Two P-values are calculated for the synergistic interaction of the pair against the two null models. The highest of the two P-values is used to assess the specificity of the interaction against the whole genome. The number of randomly selected genes in each null model is determined by N_iteration_specificity.

Sensitivity (Robustness) score defined as normalized root mean square deviation of scores calculated over 70\% of samples, selected via random sampling. The number of sub-sample iterations is determined by N_iteration_sensitivity.

All barcodes in sample_list must be 15 character long and belong to the same cohort. When sample_list is provided, cohort should be the disease cohort that they belong to, otherwise only the first element of the cohort list will be used.
