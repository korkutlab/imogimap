### How to use imogimap:

1. Use the "Input Gene" field to insert Hugo IDs of your curated list of TAP genes. 
2. Use the default ICP genes that are already included or insert your own set of ICP genes. 
3. Choose an IAP from the immune phenotype drop-down menu, and specify the TCGA disease cohort that you are interested in. 
4. Hit the  "Submit" key and and go to the "Results" tab. 

If you wish to include specificity and sensitivity statistical assessments, check the corresponding boxes and specify the number of iterations. Note that specificity and sensitivity analyses are time consuming. We recommend to leave the box unchecked for the first run, select onco-icp gene pair of interest based on synergy results, and finally conduct specificity and sensitivity analysis for the selected gene pair. 

Imogimap automatically searches for available ligand-receptor interactions and adds genes that correspond to the interacting molecules.
