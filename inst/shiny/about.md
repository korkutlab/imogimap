# About

Immuno-oncology gene interaction Maps, ImogiMap, is a method and
informatics tool to automate the combinatorial searches for interactions between tumor-associated
and immune checkpoint processes. ImogiMap enables network analysis
of combinatorial interactions between Immune checkpoint (ICP) genes, genes that are related to
tumor-associated processes (TAP), and immune associated processes (IAPs). 

TAP genes may be any set of genes that are expressed in tumor ecosystems (likely but not necessarily in the tumor cells) and with functions involving hallmarks of cancer (e.g., proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, tumor metabolism, immune evasion). IAPs may involve processes that are related to immunotherapy responses and immune states in tumor ecosystems such as Immune cell infiltration (leukocyte fraction), Immune cell type fractions, tumor mutation burden, mRNA-based pathway scores for epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) status, vascularization, and IFNG expression.By mapping the ICP-TAP interactions, ImogiMap is able to inform on underlying mechanisms that jointly relate TAPs to therapeutically actionable ICPs and IAPs that are potential therapy response predictors.
